# PastePro Readme
Small tool to send strings as keystrokes to bypass paste restrictions. (I'm looking at you, windows UAC)

Feel free to use as you wish. This is not done by any means with the best coding practises!

The tool is pretty simple. You can store strings and bind them to global hotkeys. When the hotkey is pressed -> The string assosicated with the hotkey
gets sent as keystrokes.

Some programs (windows UAC) restricts pasting, with this tool you can circumvent that. I wrote this tool because I have to deal with long passwords with remote sessions to computers over teamviewer, and I found myself banging my head to the table daily because I could not paste the long passwords.
